In my efforts to up my "interview game", in order to kick-ass in interviews with my dream company, I opted to download all of the most epic Crack The Coding Interview
videos from youtube. 

On macOS, I used homebrew to install "youtube-dl", a super-helpful YouTube download script, which also works with whole playlists..

I invoked it as:
youtube-dl --yes-playlist https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLX6IKgS15Ue02WDPRCmYKuZicQHit9kFt

This loaded all ~33 videos in to my working directory. Many had mkv file extensions, yuck.

I created the crappy little script here to normalize them all to mp4 files.

./transcodeAllWithExtension.sh mk4 mp4

ohh.. And I used ffmpeg (also installed via homebrew) to do the serious work.
